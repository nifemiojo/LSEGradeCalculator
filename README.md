# LSE Grade Calculator Web Application

## Intro
This is the code repository for the LSE Grade Calculator website that allows students to determine what grade outcome will be achieved for a given input of grades over three years of study. Hopefully this can help students understand potential grade combinations to reach their goals.

## Tools
This website is built using the Material UI and react.js libraries for the UI and python to calculate the grade outcome. The application uses a Flask API to communicate the results of the calculation. The Flask application is hosted on Heroku servers.
